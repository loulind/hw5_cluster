***TASK 1*** See ~/work/task1figures/pred_clstr_cnts.png

Here are the side lengths for which clusGap is consistently unable to 
distinguish clusters...

n=2: clusGap is consistent all the way up until side_length equals 1.
n=3 through n=5: clusGap is unable to distinguish clusters less than ~3
n=6: clusGap is unable to distinguish clusters below a side_length less than ~4

These estimates change from sample to sample, but remain approximately the same,
with clusGap being better able to distinguish clusters as n decreases and 
as side_length increases
