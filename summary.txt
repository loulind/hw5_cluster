***TASK 1*** See ~/work/task1figures/pred_clstr_cnts.png
Here are the side lengths for which clusGap is consistently unable to 
distinguish clusters...

n=2: clusGap is consistent all the way up until side_length equals 1.
n=3 through n=5: clusGap is unable to distinguish clusters less than ~3
n=6: clusGap is unable to distinguish clusters below a side_length less than ~4

These estimates change from sample to sample, but remain approximately the same,
with clusGap being better able to distinguish clusters as n decreases and 
as side_length increases



***TASK 2*** 
The algorithm did not appear to converge reliably on the true number of 
clusters. I suspect this may be due to the 100 points being thinner in the outer
shells compared to the inner shells, so the algorithm picked up on extraneous
groupings of data. I tried to scale the number of points per shell by a factor 
of the shell's squared radius, but my computer crashed when attempting to do so 
(even after I changed the code to store the transformed data so that it was
quicker inside clusGap). I presume that if the shells were more evenly 
distributed, then the algorithm would fail around lower values of max_radius, 
with max_radius==0 resulting in 1 predicted cluster. 

If I were to use a smaller d_threshold, I believe this would lead to a greater
predicted number of clusters as the algorithm picks up on more random groupings 
in my outer shells. If I increased it, I believe this would decrease the 
predicted number of clusters, especially around lower max_radius values.
